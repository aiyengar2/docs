This is because Go is a compiled language, meaning a specific file (e.g., <code>main.go</code>) must act as the entry point for execution.</p> <p>In compiled languages, you typically run a command like <code>go build main.go</code>, which produces a binary executable\u2014a file containing machine code that the operating system can execute directly.</p> <p>By contrast, Python is an interpreted language, meaning you can run <code>python main.py</code> directly without compilation.</p> <p>Compiled languages generally offer better performance since they execute native machine code. However, interpreted languages like Python are more suitable for interactive development environments such as Jupyter Notebooks, where you dynamically modify and execute code without recompilation.</p> <p>Whenever you run a program, your computer starts a process, which is an instance of your computer program executing on your computer.</p>"}]}

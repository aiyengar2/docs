# About Me

I earned a B.A. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2019, where I was part of several course staffs (Data Science, Probability Theory, Computer Security).

My career has focused on **containers & Kubernetes** with open-source contributions to Rancher.

I love exploring new topics in **cloud and AI** and continuously learning. I also enjoy writing code that is **simple, readable, and well-documented**.

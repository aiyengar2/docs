# Introduction

## Intended Audience

This section introduces the concept of an application to developers with **limited programming experience**.  

However, it assumes familiarity with **at least one programming language**, including the ability to write a basic “Hello, World!” program and an understanding of core programming concepts.  

## What are applications?

Broadly speaking, an **application** is any computer program designed to perform a specific task, excluding those necessary for operating the computer itself.  

For example, here is a simple application that prints "Hello, World!" in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

And here is the same application written in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

> **Note**: In the Go version, the code exists inside the `main` function. This is because Go is a **compiled** language, meaning a specific file (e.g., `main.go`) must act as the entry point for execution.
>
> In compiled languages, you typically run a command like `go build main.go`, which produces a **binary executable**—a file containing machine code that the operating system can execute directly.
>
> By contrast, Python is an **interpreted** language, meaning you can run `python main.py` directly without compilation.
>
> Compiled languages generally offer better performance since they execute native machine code. However, interpreted languages like Python are more suitable for interactive development environments such as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), where you dynamically modify and execute code without recompilation.

Whenever you run a program, your computer starts a **process**, which is an instance of your computer program executing on your computer.

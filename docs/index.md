# Introduction

## To the Reader

This site documents technical concepts related to **containers & Kubernetes**.

I created it to **centralize my knowledge for personal reference**, but I’m happy to make corrections or clarifications for anyone who finds it useful.

## Spotting Errors

I enjoy deep-diving into technical topics, but **my explanations may have errors**. I welcome corrections and appreciate any help in refining my understanding.

If you spot a mistake, I’d be grateful if you opened an issue at [aiyengar2/docs](https://github.com/aiyengar2/docs/issues/new) to:

- Report errors (conceptual or grammatical—nothing is too small!)

- Request clarification on any topic

- Share any other questions or concerns
